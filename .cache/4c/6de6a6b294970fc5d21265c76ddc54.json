To\n *             upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> operation.\n *          </p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *          <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html\">CreateMultipartUpload</a>)\n *          before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an\n *          upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.</p>\n *          <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive.

If you\n *          upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the\n *          previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except\n *          the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.</p>\n *          <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the\n *             <code>Content-MD5</code> header in the upload part request.

However, you have an option\n *             to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To\n *             upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> operation.\n *          </p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *          <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html\">CreateMultipartUpload</a>)\n *          before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an\n *          upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.</p>\n *          <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely\n *          identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you\n *          upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the\n *          previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except\n *          the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.</p>\n *          <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the\n *             <code>Content-MD5</code> header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data\n *          against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. </p>\n *\n *          <p>If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the\n *             <code>x-amz-content-sha256</code> header as a checksum instead of\n *             <code>Content-MD5</code>. For more information see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html\">Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version\n *             4)</a>. </p>\n *\n *\n *\n *          <p>\n *             <b>Note:</b> After you initiate multipart upload and upload\n *          one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop\n *          getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort\n *          multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts\n *          storage.</p>\n *\n *          <p>For more information on multipart uploads, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html\">Multipart Upload Overview</a> in the\n *             <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide </i>.</p>\n *          <p>For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to\n *             <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html\">Multipart Upload API and\n *             Permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *\n *          <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it\n *          writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have\n *          the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption\n *          keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in\n *          the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using\n *             <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html\">CreateMultipartUpload</a>.

Unless you are\n *          using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption\n *          parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side\n *          encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request.
