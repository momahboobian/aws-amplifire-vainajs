Upon receiving the request,\n *             Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to\n *                 <code>UPDATING</code>. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the\n *             status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Depending on the size of the stream,\n *             the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and\n *             write data to your stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>.</p>\n *         <p>To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on\n *             individual shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the\n *             final shards. These short-lived shards count towards your total shard limit for your\n *             account in the Region.</p>\n *         <p>When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that\n *             is a multiple of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify any target value within your\n *             shard limit. However, if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling\n *             action might take longer to complete. </p>\n *         <p>This operation has the following default limits.

is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request,\n *             Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to\n *                 <code>UPDATING</code>. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the\n *             status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Depending on the size of the stream,\n *             the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and\n *             write data to your stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>.</p>\n *         <p>To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on\n *             individual shards. This can cause short-lived shards to be created, in addition to the\n *             final shards. These short-lived shards count towards your total shard limit for your\n *             account in the Region.</p>\n *         <p>When using this operation, we recommend that you specify a target shard count that\n *             is a multiple of 25% (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). You can specify any target value within your\n *             shard limit. However, if you specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling\n *             action might take longer to complete. </p>\n *         <p>This operation has the following default limits.
