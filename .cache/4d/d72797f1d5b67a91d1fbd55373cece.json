For each face, the algorithm\n *       extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database.\n *       Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the\n *         <a>SearchFaces</a> and <a>SearchFacesByImage</a>\n *       operations.</p>\n *\n *          <p>For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition\n *       Developer Guide.</p>\n *          <p>To get the number of faces in a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </p>\n *\n *          <p>If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, <code>IndexFaces</code>\n *       indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model\n *       index the 100 largest faces in the input image. </p>\n *          <p>If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information\n *      is not returned in the <code>OrientationCorrection</code> field. </p>\n *          <p>To determine which version of the model you're using, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>\n *       and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of <code>FaceModelVersion</code> in the response\n *       from <code>IndexFaces</code>\n *          </p>\n *\n *          <p>For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer\n *       Guide.</p>\n *          <p>If you provide the optional <code>ExternalImageId</code> for the input image you\n *       provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the <a>ListFaces</a> operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this\n *       external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You\n *       can then use the index to find all faces in an image.</p>\n *          <p>You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the <code>MaxFaces</code> input\n *       parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index\n *       smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.</p>\n *          <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces\n *       that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a\n *       variety of common use cases. By default, <code>IndexFaces</code> chooses the quality bar that's\n *       used to filter faces.  You can also explicitly choose\n *       the quality bar. Use <code>QualityFilter</code>, to set the quality bar\n *       by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>.\n *       If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. </p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p>To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the\n *     face model or higher.
