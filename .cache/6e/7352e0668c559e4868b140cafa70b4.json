To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a\n *          valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to\n *          create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.</p>\n *          <p>Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming\n *          restrictions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html\">Working with Amazon S3\n *             buckets</a>. </p>\n *          <p>If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html\">Create Bucket</a>. </p>\n *          <p>By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can\n *          optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize\n *          latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in\n *          Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland)\n *          Region. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro\">Accessing a\n *          bucket</a>.</p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p>If you send your create bucket request to the <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> endpoint,\n *             the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in\n *             Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in\n *             the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a\n *             bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to\n *             handle 307 redirect. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html\">Virtual hosting of buckets</a>.</p>\n *          </note>\n *          <p>When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or\n *          groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to\n *          grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.</p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>Specify a canned ACL using the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header.

For more information,\n *                see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>Specify access permissions explicitly using the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>,\n *                   <code>x-amz-grant-write</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>,\n *                   <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code>\n *                headers.

For example, if you reside in\n *          Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland)\n *          Region.
