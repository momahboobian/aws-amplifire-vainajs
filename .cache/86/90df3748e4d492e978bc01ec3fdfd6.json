Use this operation to send data into\n *             the stream for data ingestion and processing. </p>\n *         <p>Each <code>PutRecords</code> request can support up to 500 records. Each record in\n *             the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5 MiB for the entire request,\n *             including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second,\n *             up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.</p>\n *         <p>You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the\n *             data; and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array\n *             requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size\n *             of the partition key and data blob.</p>\n *         <p>The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file,\n *             geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p>\n *         <p>The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that\n *             maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is\n *             used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records\n *             to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same\n *             partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream\">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\n *                 Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *         <p>Each record in the <code>Records</code> array may include an optional parameter,\n *                 <code>ExplicitHashKey</code>, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping.\n *             This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record\n *             is stored. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords\">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis\n *                 Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *         <p>The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response\n *                 <code>Records</code>. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a\n *             record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the\n *             request and response. The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same\n *             number of records as the request array.</p>\n *         <p>The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and\n *             unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records\n *             in each <code>PutRecords</code> request. A single record failure does not stop the\n *             processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering\n *             of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the\n *             stream, use <a>PutRecord</a> instead of <code>PutRecords</code>, and write to\n *             the same shard.</p>\n *         <p>A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and\n *                 <code>SequenceNumber</code> values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies\n *             the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code>\n *             parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the\n *             stream.</p>\n *         <p>An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and\n *                 <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error\n *             and can be one of the following values:\n *                 <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>.\n *                 <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the\n *                 <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> exception including the account\n *             ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information\n *             about partially successful responses, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords\">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis\n *                 Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *         <important>\n *             <p>After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order\n *                 within the stream.</p>\n *         </important>\n *         <p>By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are\n *             added to a stream.

Each record in\n *             the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5 MiB for the entire request,\n *             including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second,\n *             up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.</p>\n *         <p>You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the\n *             data; and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array\n *             requiring a partition key and data blob.

An MD5 hash function is\n *             used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records\n *             to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same\n *             partition key map to the same shard within the stream.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords\">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis\n *                 Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n *         <p>The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response\n *                 <code>Records</code>. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a\n *             record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the\n *             request and response. The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same\n *             number of records as the request array.</p>\n *         <p>The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and\n *             unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records\n *             in each <code>PutRecords</code> request. A single record failure does not stop the\n *             processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering\n *             of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the\n *             stream, use <a>PutRecord</a> instead of <code>PutRecords</code>, and write to\n *             the same shard.</p>\n *         <p>A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and\n *                 <code>SequenceNumber</code> values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies\n *             the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code>\n *             parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the\n *             stream.</p>\n *         <p>An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and\n *                 <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error\n *             and can be one of the following values:\n *                 <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>.\n *                 <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the\n *                 <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> exception including the account\n *             ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled.
