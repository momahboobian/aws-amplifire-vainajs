StopStreamEncryptionCommandOutput = __MetadataBearer;\n\n/**\n * <p>Disables server-side encryption for a specified stream. </p>\n *         <p>Stopping encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request,\n *             Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to\n *                 <code>UPDATING</code>. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the\n *             status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Stopping encryption normally takes a\n *             few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write\n *             data to your stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>. Once the status of the\n *             stream is <code>ACTIVE</code>, records written to the stream are no longer encrypted by\n *             Kinesis Data Streams. </p>\n *         <p>API Limits: You can successfully disable server-side encryption 25 times in a\n *             rolling 24-hour period. </p>\n *         <p>Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an <code>ACTIVE</code>\n *             status before all records written to the stream are no longer subject to encryption.\n *             After you disabled encryption, you can verify that encryption is not applied by\n *             inspecting the API response from <code>PutRecord</code> or\n *             <code>PutRecords</code>.</p>\n */\nexport class StopStreamEncryptionCommand extends $Command<\n  StopStreamEncryptionCommandInput,\n  StopStreamEncryptionCommandOutput,\n  KinesisClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: StopStreamEncryptionCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: KinesisClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<StopStreamEncryptionCommandInput, StopStreamEncryptionCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"KinesisClient\";\n    const commandName = \"StopStreamEncryptionCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: StopStreamEncryptionInput.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: (output: any) => output,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(input: StopStreamEncryptionCommandInput, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_json1_1StopStreamEncryptionCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(output: __HttpResponse, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<StopStreamEncryptionCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_json1_1StopStreamEncryptionCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"8a3ff87a738dd7298db7e8b6fc08c5a5","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
